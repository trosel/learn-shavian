</p>

<p>

The letter for <strong>z</strong>oo is 𐑟. Yes, it's a reversed 𐑕! Similar to the Latin s z. 𐑕 𐑟.
</p>

<p>
Compare these letters together: 𐑕 𐑟. Pronounce each of them: so, zoo. Notice that the <strong>z</strong>oo letter is lower on the line. You can remember that "zoo" actually <em>sounds</em> lower in your mouth than "so" as well.
