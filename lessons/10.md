## Lesson 10

The letter for **ar**ia is <mark>𐑸</mark>. This is another simple compound letter.

```
  𐑭  +  𐑮  =  𐑸
alms + roe = aria
```

The letter for **eer**ie is <mark>𐑽</mark>. This letter is just like "ian" but with *another* letter added in. Check out this three for one deal:

```
𐑦  +  𐑩  +  𐑮  =  𐑽
in + ago + roe = eerie
```

The letter for **oi**l is <mark>𐑶</mark>. It really is a reversed version of ounce. 

Say "*ou*nce" and your mouth is ready to pounce `𐑬`. 

Say "*oi*l" and the sound starts at the front and goes backwards, perhaps as if you've bitten down `𐑶`.

The letter for **j**oy is <mark>𐑡</mark>. Similar to how "cha" is just "tan" and "shy" mixed together, think of "joy" as "done" and "zho". Say the sounds together "d" and "zh" faster and faster.

```
  𐑛  +  𐑠  =  𐑡
done + zho = joy
```
