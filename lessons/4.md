## Lesson 4

  
The letter for <strong>eye</strong>s is <mark>𐑲</mark>.


Remember how "aim" is like "edge"? The line on the top make it have an extended glide sound? 𐑧 𐑱

  
"Eyes" adds a glide extender on the top of "ash". 𐑨 𐑲. Say "ash" ( 𐑨 ). Say "eyes" ( 𐑲 ).

The letter for <strong>n</strong>ow is <mark>𐑯</mark>. Yes, this is a mirrored version of "me". See them side-by-side: 𐑥 𐑯. When you make an "mmm" sound, you use your lips. When you make an "n" sound, you use your tongue, which is further back in your mouth. So the "now" points back and the "me" points forward!

The letter for <strong>d</strong>one is <mark>𐑛</mark>. Yep, it's an upside down "tan"! As expected, "ddd" is voiced (vocal chords triggered) and "ttt" is not. "Done" triggers the vocal chords, which are low, so it is a low letter! 

Just keep in mind that "tan" is "top" so it points up ( 𐑑 ) and "done" is dead in the ground so it points down ( 𐑛 ).

Note that "𐑨𐑯𐑛" is abbreviated to just "𐑯" in Shavian.

The letter for <strong>r</strong>oe is <mark>𐑮</mark>. This is a backwards "lamb" of course. Remember that when you make an "r" sound, your tongue is pointed further back in your mouth. The "l" sound is at the front of your mouth so it points forward: 𐑤 𐑮.
