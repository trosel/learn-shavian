The letter for **u**p is <mark>𐑳</mark>. Look closely and you will see that this letter is the same as ago, but with a ceiling above: 𐑩 𐑳

"Up" is a more accented version of "ago". When you say "ago", your vowel just floats away, out of your mouth. When you say "up", it is like you jump up and hit your head on that ceiling.

```
ago + roe = array
 𐑩  +  𐑮   =  𐑼
```

If you are an American English speaker, you may be asking why do we need this special letter when we could just use both `𐑩𐑮`?

The answer is in one of the goals of Shavian. It wants to take into account *all* English accents, including British, American, Australian, etc.

A British person would not pronounce the final "r" sound in "flavor", but an American would. So Shavian wants to have a special letter that basically says "you can pronounce this however you see fit". It is a nice compromise. See [Shavian.Info/accents](https://www.shavian.info/accents/) for more information on this!
