## Lesson 5

  
The letter for **f**ay is <mark>𐑓</mark>.

The letter for **v**ie is <mark>𐑝</mark>.

These two letters follow the same pattern as pin/bell and see/zoo. "Fay" is aspirated (breath comes out), so it is tall. "Vie" doesn't use breath, so it is deep.

The letter for **a**go is <mark>𐑩</mark>. This letter is the most common vowel in Shavian English! As you will see soon, it is also connected to other Shavian letters.

The letter for **u**p is <mark>𐑳</mark>. Look closely and you will see that this letter is the same as ago, but with a ceiling above: 𐑩 𐑳

"Up" is a stronger version of "ago". When you say "ago", your vowel just floats away, out of your mouth. When you say "up", it is like you jump up and hit your head on that ceiling.

The letter for **arr**ay is <mark>𐑼</mark>. This is the first of a new kind of letter that we will call a "compound" letter (AKA "ligature"). This means that it is two letters combined into one.

```
ago + roe = array
 𐑩  +  𐑮   =  𐑼
```
