Welcome to Shavian School!

If you want to know *what* Shavian *is*, please visit our friends at [Shavian.Info](https://shavian.info). Here at **Shavian School**, you will learn to actually *read* it!

## Why learn Shavian?

### New Perspective

> [shavian has really changed how i look at the english language more or less.](https://vanilla-shavian.neocities.org/index.html)

Shavian will change the way that you think about English. You will begin to understand pronunciation, the finer (or stranger üòÅ) points of grammar, and more.

### Brain Exercise

Despite the increase of knowledge and a new perspective, Shavian can also be used as a fun  exercise to increase your brain's [neuroplasticity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroplasticity) and stay sharp.

Even if Shavian is merely a puzzle to you, it may be the most useful puzzle you've ever done. You can actually use it to [communicate](https://discord.com/invite/Abk2Yyh)!

### Beauty

Some people just like the way that Shavian looks. There are many different [fonts](https://www.shavian.info/shavian_fonts/) to [experiment with](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/shavian/) in addition to handwriting some nice calligraphy.
