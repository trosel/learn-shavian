The letter for <strong>z</strong>oo is <mark>𐑟</mark>. Yes, it's a reversed 𐑕! Similar to the Latin s z. 𐑕 𐑟.


Compare these letters together: 𐑕 𐑟. Pronounce each of them: so, zoo. Notice that the <strong>z</strong>oo letter is lower on the line.


When you say "see", notice that air comes out of your mouth. This is called "aspiration". When you say "zoo", air doesn't come out.

In Shavian, most letters that are aspirated are <em>tall</em>. Just remember that air comes out and rises to the sky! These tall letters have cousins that are not aspirated (no air comes out). The no-air letters are <em>deep</em>. "Zoo" is a no-air letter.
