## Lesson 1

The letter for <strong>s</strong>ee is <mark>𐑕</mark>. Yep, it looks like a Latin S.

The letter for <strong>i</strong>n is <mark>𐑦</mark>. It looks like the Latin i without the dot.


The letter for <strong>e</strong>ve is <mark>𐑰</mark>. This sound is similar to "if", except it is longer. This letter looks like someone tried to lengthen the 𐑦 and it broke in the middle!

The letter for <strong>z</strong>oo is <mark>𐑟</mark>. Yes, it's a reversed 𐑕! Similar to the Latin s z. 𐑕 𐑟.


Compare these letters together: 𐑕 𐑟. Pronounce each of them: so, zoo. Notice that the <strong>z</strong>oo letter is lower on the line.


When you say "zzz", notice that your vocal chords vibrate. This is called a "voiced" sound. When you say "sss", your vocal chords don't vibrate. That is called an "unvoiced" sound.

In Shavian, most sounds that are unvoiced are <em>tall</em> and voiced sounds are <em>deep</dem>. Just remember that your vocal chords are low, so the letters are low!
